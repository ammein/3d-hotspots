### Open TheatreJS Studio
You can show or hide Studio by pressing `Alt/Option + \`

![Studio UI](https://www.theatrejs.com/images/docs/0.5/manual/studio/ui.png)

#### 1. Outline Panel
The Outline Panel displays your scene hierarchy, which includes your Projects, Sheets, Namespaces and Sheet Objects.

#### 2. Details Panel
The Details Panel lists all the props for the selected Sheet Object and lets you edit them.

#### 3. Sequence Editor
The Sequence Editor is Theatre.js' animation sequencer. Sequenced props show up in the Sequence Editor for the selected Sheet Object. The right part of the Sequence Editor is called the "Dope Sheet".

#### 4. Global Toolbar
The Global Toolbar houses buttons and switches registered by Theatre.js extensions.

#### 5. Extensions Pane
Extension Panes are window-like panes managed by extensions that can house editors for your scene.

### Save TheatreJS
To export the project, click on the name of the project in the <a href="#1-outline-panel" target='_self'>Outline Panel</a> of the studio and then click on the "Export [Project's name]" button in the top right corner of the screen as seen below.

But you need to save under directory called `assets`:
<CodeBlock language="bash" showLineNumbers>
      {`./src
├── ./src/assets`}
    </CodeBlock>
> **AND YOU MUST SAVE WITH THE SAME FILENAME `theatre-project-state.json`** otherwise, your adjusted value will not be able to read.

### TheatreJS GLB/GLTF Model Asset
You must upload any `*.glb` `*.gltf` into this `public` folder that is located in root folder:
<CodeBlock language="bash" showLineNumbers>
      {`./public
├── ./public/theatrejs-assets`}
    </CodeBlock>

> Any file that requires upload from TheatreJS UI, the file must be in `public/theatrejs-assets` folder.

Then you can import the file in TheatreJS UI in your local browser like this:

    <source src={ModelUpload} type="video/mp4"/>
